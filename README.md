# motd-dynamicbanner
Message of the Day dynamic banner. 

Most of this comes form:
- https://chrisrmiller.com/ubuntu-dynamic-motd-on-debian-9/
- https://nickcharlton.net/posts/debian-ubuntu-dynamic-motd.html

With small bits of changes to get it to work on Debian 11 (Buster), and with python3.

Working in progress.
